The objective of this two-day symposium is to gather people from
different research fields with different approaches (economics,
ethology, psychiatry, robotics, neural and computational approaches) to
decision making.

The event will take place for 3 days from the **16th to 18th** of June
2025 in Lyon at the [Palais Hirsch Amphitheatre](venue). Note that SBDM dates have been updated to avoid conflict with the RLDM conference.

Each session of the conference will be dedicated to one of the core
themes, ensuring a focused exploration of topics and in-depth
discussions.

You can find the list of confirmed speakers [here](speakers). The organizing committee will select **one additional speaker** for each session **based on submitted abstracts**.
