    "section": "",
    "text": "Each year, thousands of publications collectively deepen our understanding of the human brain and our ability to heal, influence, and alter it. These research efforts are essential to combat neurological and psychiatric diseases, whose prevalence increases as our life expectancy grows and our environment diverges from the one in which we evolved just a few thousand years ago. However, the benefits are not inherently linked to the knowledge produced by researchers. On the contrary, they entirely depend on how society as a whole decides to use it.\nIt is not the will of the researchers, but the vote of all citizens that will determine in which society this knowledge will find a function and the legitimate limits of its use. Personally, I am concerned about the use that will be made of my own work, both present and future. This is indeed why I am involved in the adventure of Hemisphère Gauche, as a way to escape a few hours a week from the austerity of the academic world to step into the chaotic but vital whirlwind of the real world.\n\nThe Development of “Biobanks”\nTo take just one example, a study published on September 19 in the prestigious journal Nature Neuroscience describes the methods and initial results of the monumental “UK Biobank” project, which aims to collect a complete set of psychological, biological, and genetic data on 500,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom aged between 40 and 70 by 2022. Its stated goal is the development of tools to predict the risks of developing certain neurodegenerative diseases on an individual scale, thereby facilitating the creation of new treatments to prevent their occurrence.\n\n\n\nFigure showing different measures of brain connectivity (a-b) collected within the UK Biobank project, and their association with various variables of interest (c-d): health, cognition, lifestyle, etc.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in an economy as deregulated as ours, we can fear that this same knowledge may also allow insurance companies, banks, and employers to assess these same vulnerabilities before establishing a contract with individuals, resulting in more unequal access to healthcare, housing, and employment. The upcoming advent of such practices – for example, including a brain imaging exam in the hiring process – is not science fiction, as there are researchers (albeit a very small minority) who recommend their implementation within a few years.\nWillem Verbeke from the University of Rotterdam, for instance, supports the idea that a battery of neurobiological exams could detect at-risk profiles in advance before hiring individuals for important positions:\n\n“If someone wanted to become the director of a company, I would probably want a scan of their brain first to be sure they do not have psychopathic or autistic tendencies.” source (my translation)\n\nIn this specific case, good luck to Verbeke in detecting psychopathic tendencies by glancing at a candidate’s brain, because it will take neurosciences at least 20 years, if not more, to make such diagnostics. However, the problem is not so much practical as it is ethical. Other diseases, such as Parkinson’s, are much closer to being anticipated. And already, brain data can give a rough idea of an individual’s intelligence quotient, so much so that others imagine using it at the time of university admissions… What will we decide the day these technologies are truly available?\n\n\nImagining the Flip Side Without Undercutting Ourselves\nFurthermore, the “screening” of populations for profit is not the only potential misuse of knowledge generated by neuroscience. There are others, which I will address in the future, among them the commodification of brain modification techniques, neuromarketing, and the fallacious use of scientific conclusions for political ends (we notably remember comments by Nicolas Sarkozy on pedophilia and suicidal tendencies).\nIt is obviously heart-breaking for researchers to communicate about these potential deviations, but it seems to me that a constructive dissemination of knowledge also involves warning against its less thrilling applications. Because we are best placed to imagine the benefits, as well as the risks, associated with the scientific advancements in which we participate.\nOriginal article (Wayback Archive)"

    "title": "Towards Self-Assessment and Horizontal Resource Control in Academia?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, a group of French researchers published an op-ed in Le Monde announcing their collective intention to apply for the presidency of the HCERES, France’s highest public authority for regulating and guiding research. This initiative, notably driven by rogueESR, has garnered over 5000 supports, including mine.\nResponsible for evaluating all research laboratories in France, the HCERES and its predecessor, the AERES, have accompanied—and often encouraged—the transformation of the French scientific landscape since 2006. Indeed, this “High Committee for the Evaluation of Research and Higher Education” is historically linked to the creation of the ANR (National Research Agency), which shifted French research toward an Anglo-Saxon “project-based” funding system in 2005.\n\nA System Under Critique for 15 Years\nThis significant structural reform has provoked much discussion and exertion over the past 15 years. Indeed, it involves researchers dedicating a significant portion of their time to drafting funding applications that have little chance of success. Despite slight improvements since 2015, the success rate remains around 15%, with many agreeing that the time lost writing and evaluating these funding applications is largely counterproductive, both scientifically and economically, given the ANR’s enormous operational costs.\nIn this context, the op-ed published in Le Monde at the beginning of 2020 is just the latest in a long series (see here, here, here, here, or there). Will it have as much impact as the mass resignation of prominent ANR figures in 2016, who, refusing to cope with continuous budget cuts under Sarkozy and Hollande, perhaps helped increase the overall budget dedicated to the structure?\nIt’s uncertain, especially considering how the current executive treats demands coming “from below” and considering that the likely candidate for the presidency of the HCERES is none other than Thierry Coulhon, a former advisor to the Fillon government and now advising Emmanuel Macron on “education, higher education, research, and innovation”.\nHowever, the unprecedented interest of this op-ed paradoxically lies in reminding us of a very simple but often forgotten fact: in terms of research evaluation, “the bottom” is actually “the top” since no one is better placed to assess scientific output than the researchers themselves. They are the ones, not ministers or the President, who are best positioned to anticipate upcoming revolutions, determine which research lines are dead ends and which are promising, or to evaluate the material and human resources required to achieve set goals.\nWith this idea in mind, members of the rogueESR collective urge the entire scientific community to engage with the question in their latest letter:\n\nThe second phase of this nascent movement of reaffirming the scholarly world as forming a community capable of setting its own rules, this immense freedom being balanced by a principle of responsibility towards society, requires everyone’s participation. What strategy can we employ, by curbing all forms of bureaucracy, to agree, beyond partisan divisions, on the University and the research system we aspire to bring to life. Our email is open to all thoughtful tactical and strategic proposals.\n\nI seize the opportunity to submit a proposal as radically different from the current system as from the previous one. Given the ANR’s programmed failure, it might be tempting to nostalgically contemplate the past and its “inter-ministerial funding”—less time-consuming and more flexible for researchers—but this would be a serious mistake, in my opinion.\nIndeed, if one can consider that the reforms which gave birth to the ANR were an opportunity for the then-government to hold a “modernization discourse” that masked—like a smokescreen—the upcoming budget cuts, these reforms were still based on strong dissatisfaction with the old system. It is informative to revisit the report on research studied at the National Assembly on December 21, 2004. Many criticisms targeted the overly hierarchical allocation of credits (following a ministry - institute - laboratory - researcher scheme) whose major flaw was to fuel local nepotisms, often allowing laboratory directors to distribute resources at their discretion; and often at the expense of the most innovative or risky projects carried by younger researchers still poorly integrated into the complex power games that academia has always known. The shift to project-based funding has at least had the virtue of de-siloing all researchers and establishing a horizontal competition theoretically allowing each to compete directly for resources.\n\n\nA Framework-Breaking Proposal\nIs it possible to combine the flexibility of the old system with the horizontality of the new, while taking a real step towards a more free, more creative science whose management would involve “everyone’s participation”? It seems to me that yes.\nThe idea is as follows: instead of awarding funding by project or by laboratory, the state could directly allocate a portion of its credits to each actor in the research process, according to a system blending scientific merit and seniority. From the PhD student at the end of their thesis to the senior research director, including the research engineer and the postdoc, each person contributing to advancing knowledge would thus control a fraction of the credits available for their branch.\nAt each hierarchical level, the allocation would increase significantly, reflecting despite everything the evolution of scientific expertise. In the field of cognitive neuroscience, for example, the state could allocate five thousand euros per year for doctoral students at the end of their thesis, twenty thousand euros for non-tenured researchers (i.e., postdocs), and fifty thousand euros for tenured researchers and research engineers. If this idea may seem subversive with respect to the traditional hierarchical organization, it is not by accident. In reality, it’s simply about pushing the logic of rogueESR to the limit.\nIf researchers are to collectively evaluate and control research, isn’t it natural to assign to each of them a part of the available resources, to be employed according to their expertise and motivations? Since it is common to consider that a PhD student at the end of their thesis has already become an expert regarding their research theme, and since postdocs are often seen as true locomotives of academia, isn’t it sensible to include these two categories in the collective system of evaluation and control being discussed?\nA natural objection is that this organization seems at first glance highly individualistic, each researcher then having their little patch of land to cultivate their particular interests. However, it should be noted that the project-based funding as we know it is already highly individualistic since the funding is associated with a single person rather than a collective, both at the French and European levels. Moreover, in this new system, no one would have the “firepower” necessary to carry out major projects, so that collaboration and pooling of resources would be imposed on anyone with big scientific ambitions.\nBy setting up a platform allowing both the submission of projects, the call for contributions, and the allocation of resources, each actor could then organize a fundraising campaign among their peers, in exchange for an authorship place and/or a proportionate right to oversee the publications resulting from this pooling. The state could promote this type of cooperative logic by awarding additional funding to projects that have received enough contributions, thus breaking with the zero-sum game principle.\n\n\nFighting Academic “Branding” and the Reign of Researcher-Communicators\nThe great virtue of this system would be to put each researcher before the following dilemma: work alone with limited means or work collectively with significantly greater means, so that personal ambitions would systematically be weighed against scientific ambitions; and this, unlike the current system where building a personal reputation and brand (“academic branding”) very largely conditions the ability to fulfill our scientific ambitions, benefiting the researchers most skilled in communication.\nSuch an initiative would undoubtedly multiply the inventiveness of researchers at every level and would also allow for better exploitation of the inter-individual differences that exist in academia. For example, in the field of neuroscience, as in many others, “theorists” generally do not need a lot of their own resources to do their work. A few good computers suffice. However, they urgently need to be able to rely on work informing and constraining the theories they develop. In such a system, these same theorists could thus make their credits available to “experimentalists” who have submitted the most useful projects to them, or directly issue a call for contributions for the experiments they most need.\n\n\n\nProposed distribution schema\n\n\nCertainly, such a reform could not be imposed on the scientific community overnight, and it would undoubtedly take years of local experimentation to develop the necessary tools and refine the logistical and ethical aspects of this entirely “bottom-up” participative system, to borrow an Anglicism that scientists are fond of.\nBut if we want to hold all researchers accountable for the future of research, and if we want them all to intervene in its evaluation, if we want to fight both bureaucratic arbitrariness and hierarchical arbitrariness, we will have to give them the counterpart of this new responsibility: control over the available resources. Without this, a system proceeding by the nomination of representatives in charge of control, evaluation, and distribution of resources seems inevitable, whether they be laboratory directors or bureaucrats employed by central institutions like the ANR.\nFor dispensing with such representatives and for freeing the vital forces of academia while advocating self-management, it is essential that everyone contribute to this work of evaluation, orientation, and pooling.\n\n\nTo Go Further\nAs part of this collective movement, two public sessions of the “Science Policies” seminar will be held at the EHESS on January 30 and February 6 next. These meetings will undoubtedly provide an opportunity to discuss many other proposals imagined by researchers to reform the system as we know it.\nSee the program, here.\nOriginal article (Wayback Machine)"

    "section": "A Question of Bad Faith?",
    "text": "A Question of Bad Faith?\nSchematically, any conspiracy theory or anti-theory is rooted either in the desire to defend a specific interest or ideology, or in the intent to promote the “truth” about observed historical events. Thus, bad faith discourses oppose good faith discourses, in both camps, and the challenge is to consider the interests and ideologies defended by each side without reducing criticism to a series of ad hominem arguments that attribute credibility or discredit to different discourses solely based on the speaker.\nIt is not because an individual is an engineer at Monsanto, a government minister, a member of an anti-Zionist association, or a journalist at a major media outlet that their discourse should be taken as inherently true or false. It is the test of facts and adherence to logic that should constitute the standard of truth in this area as in any other.\nBad faith only begins when we continue to defend a false belief because it justifies our current or future actions. For example, imagine that in January 2016, French intelligence discovers that the November attacks were actually carried out by jihadists residing in Egypt, in retaliation for France’s military support to dictator al-Sisi, who is himself responsible for the massacre at Rabia-El-Adawiya Square. It is understandable that such a discovery would be difficult to communicate to the French public, as it would require justifying France’s position on Syrian and Egyptian issues differently. In this situation, what to do? The simplest solution might seem to be to maintain an official version of events while working behind the scenes to refocus the fight against our real enemies. But once such a divergence is created between official history and real history, how can we prevent citizens, journalists, and academics seeking understanding from pointing out inconsistencies and speculating on undisclosed information?"

    "section": "Pious Lies of the State and Democracy",
    "text": "Pious Lies of the State and Democracy\nThe moral legitimacy of the pious lie is linked to a millennial philosophical question, to which this post does not need to take a side. We will only point out that, in this matter, the “deontological” approach defended by thinkers who aim for truth, such as Kant or Plato, contrasts with the “utilitarian” approach advocated by thinkers aiming for happiness, such as Rousseau or Mill.\nNot all lies are pious, but believing that all lies are told with malicious intent is a sign of extreme and pathological conspiracism. Yes, we are likely lied to, but why assume that every lie necessarily reflects a malevolent intention towards the French people in general or a particular minority of French citizens? Let us guard against this type of conspiracism and assume that the lies that create a divergence between real history and official history stem from good intentions.\nBy definition, a pious lie submits the ideal of Truth to the quest for Good, and if we are subjected to such a lie, it means that individuals with access to the “truth” believe it to be contrary to the “good” of those without access to it, resulting in a double problem.\n\nOn one hand, where does the idea come from that the public would be incapable of understanding and accepting the real reasons behind a political decision or a war?\nOn the other hand, where does this “good” pursued by those who lie so piously come from?\n\nIn other words, the pious lie is based on the distinction between two social classes: one enlightened and informed, deciding for another, confused and misinformed. In fact, in this enlightening 2009 interview, François Hollande himself denounced the perverse logic of state lies told in the name of the fight against terrorism.\nFrançois Hollande in 2009, on the Sarkozy government’s handling of the terrorist issue\nFurthermore, as beneficial as they might be for maintaining public order and the homeland as a whole, some pious lies can have detrimental consequences. In fact, it is often the plausibility of the lie and the skill with which it is executed that determine its adverse effects. Imagine a doctor trying to reassure a patient by hiding part of the test results. If the doctor lies poorly or if some of their pious lies have been discovered in the past, the patient, lacking confidence, might imagine suffering from a more serious illness than the one they actually have!\nIn the social and political realm, bad lies, when detected as such, can cause the public to fear the future and others more than if the truth were exposed by “those who know.” To take a recent example, it is difficult to believe in the fortuitous nature of the “suicide” of Commissioner Helric Fredou on the very night of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. This case, on which the government only communicated in December, despite a request from a deputy in January, has actively fueled various conspiracy theories. What might appear as a necessary pious lie has thus become the focal point of often fantastical and terrifying discourses about the supposed involvement of the government in this series of murders. One might even think that the truth about this somewhat mysterious death – however unsettling – would be far less worrying than the speculations induced by the government’s silence.\nIf we assume that some pious lies are useful and necessary for the exercise of power, should we then urge those who lie to “lie better,” as Didier Super humorously does in one of his recent videos?\n\n\n\nA sign “Stop your nonsense: read” in tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack, on the monument at Place de la République, January 11, 2015, Paris - JOEL SAGET/AFP\n\n\nUnless we fall into a mystifying idealism that believes the government and media always know and relay the entire truth about the history unfolding before our eyes, the above considerations justify critical reflection, investigative journalism, and a generally skeptical position towards discourses from both the most dominant and the most protesting castes in our society. Nevertheless, why does this noble quest for truth so often take the form of a conspiracy theory and conspiracism, which involves attributing responsibility for significant events and the simultaneous construction of the official version to a small group of people organized in a secret society?\nThere are many possible answers to this question, but three main causes can be distinguished for the emergence of such theories.\n\nOn one hand, conspiracies and plots have existed and still exist, so it can sometimes be justified to consider this hypothesis – with all the necessary precautions.\nOn the other hand, as a discourse, conspiracism can serve to defend specific interests or promote particular ideologies. For example, sites like Panamza or Égalité et Réconciliation clearly distinguish themselves by their anti-Zionism, so the systematic search for connections between the State of Israel and the attacks in France appears more as a business model than investigative journalism.\nFinally, as explained very well (among other things) in the special issue of the Agone history journal published in January 2012, the very term “conspiracy theory” is sometimes used to actively discredit certain non-conforming discourses and forms of investigative journalism.\n\nWhile we can understand why conspiracy theories emerge in public debate, these explanations do not tell us why they sometimes irrationally captivate their audience. This is where (neuro)sciences can help."

    "text": "Theory of Mind\nAs we have seen earlier, when the truth is obscured about important events, even if it is to facilitate governance oriented towards the public good, it can lead to a significant loss of trust in the official discourse, whether it comes directly from those who govern or the media that relay their statements. Thus, the citizen finds themselves in suspense and the field of “possible truths” expands: in addition to the difficulty of understanding already tremendously complex facts, there is added uncertainty about the facts themselves.\nNow, what “cognitive tools” are available to humans confronted with such uncertainties? There are two main cognitive mechanisms that can be activated:\n\nTo hold to previously acquired knowledge, since the human mind tends to prefer certainty. For instance, if a subject has previously believed that an attack was carried out by jihadists of Saudi origin, they are more likely to think that new and diverse information will fit within this preconceived framework.\nTo try to attribute the observed facts to a coherent, internalized representation of a global truth, even if this representation is completely speculative or unverified. This cognitive tendency to seek an overall coherence has been extensively studied under the umbrella of the “theory of mind” in cognitive sciences.\n\n\nTheory of Mind: The Role of Agency and Conspiracy\nThe theory of mind involves the ability to attribute mental states (like beliefs, desires, and intentions) to oneself and others. This cognitive ability allows individuals to understand that others have thoughts and perspectives that differ from their own. It’s crucial for social interactions and understanding intentions behind actions.\nWhen a significant event occurs, and there’s a lack of transparent information, people tend to employ their theory of mind to make sense of it. This often leads them to infer the presence of hidden agents or intentions behind the events. For instance, if an attack occurs and official explanations seem unsatisfactory, people might infer that a hidden group or agency is responsible, trying to fill in the gaps with their own theories.\nThe Agency Detection Framework is one theoretical perspective that explains why people might believe in conspiracy theories. According to this framework, humans have evolved to detect agency – that is, to recognize when intentional actions are at play. This ability is essential for survival, helping humans avoid danger and understand the behavior of others. When faced with ambiguous or complex events, this innate tendency can lead people to attribute the events to malevolent agents or secretive groups, even when there is no concrete evidence.\n\n\nCoherence Theory: Making Sense of the World\nThe coherence theory suggests that people strive to create a coherent narrative that makes sense of disparate pieces of information. When faced with incomplete or conflicting information, individuals attempt to construct a unified story that ties together the available facts. This drive for coherence can lead people to adopt conspiracy theories, as these theories often offer a seemingly comprehensive explanation that ties together various elements of an event in a way that makes sense within the theory’s framework.\nIn summary, the human brain’s tendency to detect agency and seek coherence plays a significant role in the formation and attraction of conspiracy theories. When faced with uncertain or incomplete information, people use these cognitive mechanisms to construct and cling to theories that provide a sense of understanding and predictability in an otherwise chaotic and opaque world."

    "text": "Conclusion\nUnderstanding the cognitive underpinnings of conspiracy theories helps us appreciate why they captivate and persist despite a lack of concrete evidence. By recognizing the role of theory of mind, agency detection, and coherence theory, we can better grasp why some people are drawn to these theories and how they function in the broader context of information processing and belief formation. This insight also highlights the importance of critical thinking and transparent communication in mitigating the spread and impact of conspiracy theories."
