Allocating time optimally presents a universal challenge for all organisms because the future benefits of time investments are uncertain. In this talk, I will present a novel normative framework for assessing bounded optimality in time allocation, emphasizing the accuracy of future predictions, independent of subjective costs and benefits. I will show how we can apply this framework to investigate rational time investment across species using a post-decision time investment task. We found that mice, rats, and humans scaled their time investment with decision confidence, irrespective of subjective valuation, demonstrating bounded optimality in time allocation. We then turn the normative model into an elementary algorithm based on a drift-diffusion process, which implements optimal time investment strategies, providing a testbed for identifying its neural correlates. Single neurons in rat orbitofrontal cortex encode key components of this strategy, such as confidence and trial-by-trial time investment. These results illuminate the computational and neural mechanisms governing rational time investment across species."

Early social experiences, particularly interactions with caregivers, are fundamental for the healthy development of socio-cognitive abilities. When these experiences are absent or severely disrupted, as in the case of ESD, the consequences can be long-lasting and affect both emotional and cognitive domains. Our results indicate that early adversity interferes with the normal developmental trajectory of prefrontal networks, especially in their connectivity with limbic and striatal areas during adolescence. These alterations compromise the capacity for cognitive control over emotional responses, leading to increased emotional reactivity and anxiety, and reduced flexibility in task involving inhibitory control and behavioral change strategy. The affected individuals tend to rely more on habitual rather than goal-directed strategies, particularly in socially challenging situations. By using a non-human primate model, our work contributes to a better understanding of how early social environments shape the neurobiological foundations of social behavior and emotional regulation, with implications for the study of vulnerability to mental health disorders."

Disruptions in interoceptive awareness have emerged as key factors across various disorders, including depression, anxiety, and neurological conditions. In this talk, I will present novel computational and psychophysical methods developed by our lab, designed to precisely measure interoception across cardiac, respiratory, and gastric domains. I will illustrate how these methods help uncover brain-body interactions in common mental health conditions and functional neurological disorders. Lastly, I will share recent findings demonstrating that interoception can be therapeutically enhanced by pharmacologically targeting peripheral bodily signals, highlighting potential avenues for innovative treatments."

One example is during threat anticipation: a threat of electrical shock produces cardiac deceleration, and is linked to improved stimulus detection. However, evidence for a causal relationship between the afferent cardiac signal and perception has been difficult to obtain. Here, we investigated this by amplifying the afferent cardiac signal with transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). We applied short-burst, sham controlled taVNS to participants’ left cymba conchae while they performed a near-threshold perceptual decisions task (present/absent) under threat-of-shock versus safety. Heart rate was measured with an electrocardiogram, and was unaffected by taVNS. The behavioural results suggest that threat trials significantly decreased the decision criterion relative to safe trials, while significantly increasing the hit rate (proportion of correct detections), reflecting an increased tendency to report target presence under threat. There was no difference between the active and sham stimulation conditions on criterion, hit rate, or sensitivity (d’). Those early results suggest that stimulating the afferent cardiac-brain axis might not affect perceptual decisions under threat. We discuss alternative explanations and the suitability of taVNS as a modulatory tool."

Rather than processing all decision-relevant information, we often rely on fast habitual and/or intuitive decision policies, which can lead to irrational biases and errors. Yet, we don’t always follow the fast and negligent lead of habits or intuitions. So what determines how much time and effort we invest when making decisions? A possibility is that the amount of cognitive resources the brain allocates to a given task (in particular, a decision task) optimizes a cost-benefit tradeoff. Our working hypothesis is that decision confidence serves as the benefit term of this resource allocation problem, hence the “metacognitive” nature of decision control. Here, we provide behavioural evidence that mice regulate their allocation of cognitive resources according to a confidence/effort a tradeoff. The importance of this work is twofold. On the computational side of things, we show whether and how this eventually enables them to override their default/automatic policy. On the behavioural side of things, we validate all the ensuing model predictions, in the context of an experimental setup with high ecological validity."

Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we discovered in the macaque monkey brain a network of areas centered on the medial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus, temporal pole and parietal area 7A, that is engaged in social interaction analysis. Its extent and location suggest that this function is an evolutionary forerunner of human mind-reading capabilities. A comparative fMRI investigation in humans additionally revealed which neural strategies adapted to the needs of each species, and emphasized human interest in understanding actions of our peers directed towards objects. Further by integrating the nature and frequency of interactions over time, relationships emerge. Kinship, hierarchy, and friendship are relationships that shape Primates structured societies. Preliminary brain imaging results in one rhesus macaque from a semi free-ranging group, suggest an encoding of social network topological variables. Signal in pSTS, area 7a, precuneus, and dmPFC correlated with similarity in social distance; while vlPFC, vmPFC, and ACC in similarity in centrality. Together these studies show how our primate brains continuously process individuals and social scenes unwinding in front of us."

Neural replay, a phenomenon where rodents reactivate representations of remote locations in rapid sequences, suggests the existence of similar mechanisms in biological brains. Indeed, recent theories have shown how neural replay can implement such decision-making computations. Here, I will exploit the famous hippocampal capacities for episodic memory and scene construction to propose yet another function for replay: the composition of new cognitive maps through combinations of generalisable building blocks. I rely on replay as the mechanism for building these new combinations and storing them in memory. Computationally, this model explains how new plans can be rapidly constructed, to avoid online planning and credit assignment altogether. Empirically, it predicts new hippocampal spatial responses at locations that have been visited in replay. I will show evidence for this emergence of place fields in replay in a reanalysis of a memory-guided spatial navigation experiment. Together, these results show how replay may construct compositional cognitive maps to create memories of the future."

To date, systematic administration of pharmacological agents provides the only opportunity to causally manipulate synaptic transmission in healthy human volunteers. I will present a series of studies in which we administered drugs targeting NMDA and GABAA receptors to healthy humans and investigated their effects on both perceptual and reward-guided decision making, and on learning under both stable and non-stationary task contingencies. These results will be contrasted with insights gained from measuring natural variations in GABA and glutamate with MR spectroscopy. In addition, we reasoned that M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors might also play a key role in decision making, owing to their importance both in supporting NMDA-dependent ionic currents and in modulating the activity of GABAergic interneurons. Surprisingly, blocking M1 receptors did not affect reward-guided choice, but impaired learning under high levels of uncertainty. Where available, MEG data will be presented to show how the drugs affected task-related neural activity. Finally, a role for acetylcholine in cost-benefit decision making will be discussed and contrasted with the more established role of dopamine D2 receptors. I will conclude with some methodological considerations for psychopharmacological studies."

Persecutory delusion (the belief that others are harmful) is a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia and is thought to stem from misinterpretations of social cues. However, contemporary neurocognitive models of delusions frequently neglect the social dimension. This project aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to the emergence of delusion, in particular persecutory delusion, by combining experimental psychology and computational modeling. Ketamine was used as a pharmacological model of psychosis, as it transiently and safely induces early schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individuals. However, the effects of ketamine on social inference remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a randomized, crossover study in which healthy volunteers received either ketamine or a placebo. A novel cognitive task was employed to investigate how subjects infer intentions to others from ambiguous social cues (i.e., faces displaying varying degrees of smiling or hostile expressions) to guide their decisions. Using a Bayesian computational approach, we demonstrated that ketamine alters the inference of intentions from facial expressions. Beyond refining the use of ketamine as a model of psychosis, these findings provide new insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying the emergence of persecutory delusion in schizophrenia."

One of the most important results of the last century is that how one represents information changes what one can do with it. I will show that different representations imply different information processing pipelines, which I will identify as different decision systems. I will show that these different information processing pipelines are identifiable in the temporal dynamics of neurophysiology, including specifically testable (and confirmed!) predictions.

Here we describe a unique feature of adult human neuroanatomy compared to chimpanzees that may provide an explanation of changes that occurred to enable the capacity for speech: the Prefrontal Frontal Operculum (PFO) region, which is located in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, adjacent and medial to the classical Broca’s area. We show that, in chimpanzees, individuals with the most human-like PFO, particularly in the left hemisphere, have greater oro-facial and vocal motor control abilities. We also show that, on the basis of Functional connectivity (FC) results in the human brain, PFO is subdivided in two regions (aPFO and pPFO), displaying strong interactions but distinct whole brain FC profiles with respectively the language and the cognitive control networks, and thus suggesting a critical role of PFO in the cognitive control of speech. Finally, FC fingerprint analyses in macaques revealed similarities with pPFO, but we found no macaque homologue of human aPFO. These discoveries, when combined with recent paleontological evidence, suggests that aPFO is a recently evolved feature of human cortical structure (perhaps limited to the genus Homo) that emerged in response to increasing selection for cognitive and motor functions evident in modern speech abilities.\nWebsite: https://sbri.fr/public-profile/23/single-member/"

I will specifically focus on the non-verbal signals that are taken into account to make such decisions and the degree to which such signals are informative. Notably, beauty and friendly facial expressions (i.e. smiles) are taken as strong signals regarding the trustworthiness of others.

While prior research has established a positive influence of motivation on creative abilities, the role of reward and subjective valuation in creativity remains poorly understood. In this talk, I will present a series of studies that investigate how individual preferences—how people subjectively value ideas—influence creative thinking. First, I will discuss behavioral experiments combined with computational modeling using the Free Generation of Associates Task (FGAT) paired with rating tasks. Our results show that ideas judged as more preferable are generated more rapidly, suggesting that valuation processes are engaged during idea generation. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that subjective value depends on both the adequacy and originality of ideas, and that these valuations guide response selection and creative output. Next, I will present findings indicating that valuation processes are consistently engaged across a variety of creative tasks. I will then turn to neuroimaging results revealing the involvement of the Brain Valuation System during creative idea generation, further supporting the role of subjective valuation in this process. Finally, I will present a study in which participants’ preferences were experimentally modulated to provide causal evidence for the influence of subjective valuation on creativity. Together, these findings offer converging behavioral, computational, neural, and causal evidence for the central role of subjective valuation mechanisms in creative thinking."

The structure of these networks affects economic behavior, market dynamics, and collaboration and coordination within organizations, with implications for financial stability, cooperation, competition, and policy adoption. Understanding how individuals make decisions within these interconnected systems is essential for addressing challenges such as the spread of misinformation, political polarization, and social conformity. While behavioral economics and computational social science have made progress in modeling decision-making in structured environments, many questions remain about the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms driving these processes. Advances in these fields provide valuable insights into how individuals process social and economic incentives, update beliefs based on network interactions, and navigate complex strategic environments. This workshop will bring together perspectives from economics, psychology, and computational social neuroscience to explore how individuals make decisions in social and economic contexts. Through recent empirical and theoretical approaches, we aim to deepen our understanding of decision-making in networked environments.\n\n\nSchedule\nFor more information about the speakers, see next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\nEvent\nSpeaker(s)\n\n\n\n\n09:00\nArrival at Institut des Sciences Cognitives\n\n\n\n09:15\nWelcome address\n\n\n\n09:30\nTalk\nOriel Feldman Hall\n\n\n10:15\nTalk\nJean-Claude Dreher\n\n\n11:00\nCoffee break\n\n\n\n11:30\nTalk\nEdoardo Gallo\n\n\n12:15\nTalk\nFriederike Mengel\n\n\n13:00\nLunch (provided)\n\n\n\n14:00\nTalk\nDamon Centola\n\n\n14:45\nTalk\nFréderic Moisan\n\n\n15:30\nCoffee break\n\n\n\n15:45\nTalk\nArno Riedl\n\n\n16:30\nGeneral discussion\nFrom submissions\n\n\n17:00\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nOriel Feldman Hall (neuroscience - Brown Univ) - https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/\nTitle: Cognitive maps of social networks\nThe success of the human species depends on our ability to successfully navigate through our complex social communities, where our friends are connected to many others, who are in turn connected to others, and so on. Our social networks are extraordinarily dense, complex, and continually evolving as friendships are made and broken. It is an enormous challenge to figure out how people are connected within a network, and continually update one’s representation as the network inevitably shifts over time. Yet, knowing your social network’s structure affords many advantages, such as being able to disseminate information, manage one’s own (and others) reputations, or even strategically figure out how to occupy a central position. I will discuss our recent research probing the mechanisms that underpin how humans learn about the relationships in social networks, and the format of representation they use to encode these social networks: abstract cognitive maps. We find that abstract maps are used to solve multiple different social navigation problems, from climbing the social ladder into positions of influence to learning to gossip with the right people.\nJean-Claude Dreher (neuroeconomics – Lyon) - https://dreherteam.wixsite.com/neuroeconomics\nTitle: Brain computations engaged in social network interactions\nSocial networks play a crucial role in creating links between individuals and in informal transmission of information across society. Although the computations engaged in social learning have started to be investigated in dyadic interactions and in very small groups, little is known about the mechanisms used by the brain when individuals interact in social networks. I will present recent theoretical and experimental work shedding light on the computations people use to integrate and transmit information in social networks. I will show that a variant of the classical DeGroot learning rule captures transmission of information in social networks better than a sequential error-driven process using successive weighted update of one’s neighbors’ opinions. I will also present recent fMRI results showing how the brain decides whether to share extra information with others, depending upon one’s own confidence about the reliability of information and upon our beliefs concerning the preferences of receivers. Finally, I will present an Agent-Based model of dynamic network formation where individuals act asynchronously based on a partial view of the network. This model converges towards the most efficient network structure, showing that seemingly complex behaviors in such game emerges from decentralized, homogenous, payoff-driven agents. Together, these results pave the way to develop a mechanistic understanding of social learning mechanisms used by networked individuals interacting dynamically in real time.\nEdo Gallo (economics - Cambridge) - https://www.edoardogallo.com\nTitle: Money vs social exclusion in networks\nGlobalization offers unparalleled opportunities to expand economic welfare across large networks of unrelated individuals. Social exclusion – permanent or temporary – and monetary exchange are institutions that in theory can incentivize cooperation. In an experiment, we evaluate their relative performance and interaction in anonymous networks of different sizes. Permanent social exclusion (ostracism) leads to sparse networks, which reduces long-run economic potential. Monetary exchange and temporary social exclusion perform similarly well in small networks. Yet, in large networks monetary exchange is the only institution that promotes full cooperation as it completely crowds out ostracism and maintains the network intact. An insight is that monetary systems outperform social exclusion mechanisms in promoting cooperation in globalized social and economic networks.\nFriederike Mengel (economics - Essex) - https://sites.google.com/site/friederikemengel/\nTitle: Influence in Social Networks\nIn a series of laboratory and online experiments, we investigate the perceived and actual influence, direct and indirect, that early movers have over later movers in a sequential-move binary-action coordination game played on a network. Each human subject is assigned to a particular node in a specified 5 or 10 node network, and chooses In or Out knowing how many neighbors have previously chosen In. We measure influence in terms of the number of In choices that follow an initial exogenous In versus Out choice. Influence is quite heterogeneous across different network positions. Human subjects are aware of their influence and act on it, but overestimate their influence on average. A simple adaptive learning model explains entry and perceptions of influence reasonably well, especially for well connected nodes.\nDamon Centola (sociology - University of Pennsylvania) https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/damon-centola-phd\nTitle: The “New” Science of Collective Intelligence\nCan networks protect us from disinformation? Can the science of collective intelligence restore our capacity for productive online discourse? I offer new findings on the intelligence of collectives, which show that the greatest source of group wisdom is people’s ability to influence one another. However, the key to our collective intelligence lies in the structure of that influence. I present results from a series of independently replicated and experimentally controlled online disinformation campaigns regarding vaccine safety. I show how changes to the topological connectivity of online networks enable “wisdom of the crowd” learning dynamics that effectively counteract disinformation campaigns, even among homogeneous populations (i.e., “echo chambers”) subjected to targeted attacks. These results reveal an unexpected relationship between network structure and the emotional quality of online discussions, which correspond to significant changes in communities’ endogenous capacity for distributed collective learning.\nFrédéric Moisan (behavioral economics, Lyon) - https://em-lyon.com/en/frederic-moisan/research\nTitle: Experimental Evidence on Group Size Effects in Network Formation Games\nThis paper presents experimental evidence on games where individuals can unilaterally decide on their links with each other. Linking decisions give rise to directed graphs. We consider two classes of situations: one, benefits flow along the direction of the network paths (one-way flow), and two, when the benefits flow on network paths without regard to the direction of links (two-way flow). Our experiments reveal that in the one-way flow model subjects create sparse networks whose distance grows and efficiency falls as group size grows; by contrast, in the two-way flow model subjects create sparse and small world networks whose efficiency remains high in both small and large groups. We show that a bounded rational model that combines myopic best response with targeting a most connected individual provides a coherent account of our experimental data.\nArno Riedl (behavioral economics – Maastricht) - https://www.arnoriedl.com/\nTitle: Coordination and Network Proximity: Experimental Evidence from the Field (with Ben D’Exelle and Christine Gutekunst)\nWe conduct a field experiment in real-world social networks to analyse the influence of network proximity on the ability of two persons to coordinate costly effort. Using data on the friendship networks of 22 villages in Uganda, we identify the effect of proximity between two participants by experimentally varying the effort costs and the disclosure of their identities. We find that effort in the coordination task is higher if the paired participants are friends and have common friends, i.e., they are part of the same triad. We do not find support for alternative measures of network proximity that involve a different combination of direct and common friends.\n\n\n\nSponsors"

While dopamine neurotransmission is known to modulate anxiety levels in humans and animal models, its regulatory effects on the anterior insula remained unexplored. Here, using a multifaceted approach, we uncovered how dopamine shapes anterior insula function in anxiety-related behaviors. First, we reveal a high density of neurons expressing type-1 dopamine receptors (D1) in the insula, particularly important in the anterior section, and seven times greater than the density of neurons expressing type-2 dopamine receptors (D2). Importantly, few neurons co-expressed Drd1 and Drd2 mRNAs in the anterior and posterior insula, and the density of Drd1+ neurons in the anterior insula was twice higher among inhibitory neurons than excitatory neurons. We then found that pharmacological activation of D1 in the anterior insula is anxiogenic, supporting a causal link between insular dopamine signaling and anxiety-related behaviors. Consistently, using fiber-photometry recordings, we identified an increase of dopamine release onto D1+ neurons in the anterior insula while mice were located in anxiogenic spaces, and that the amplitude of this increase is positively correlated with mice level of anxiety. Using population dynamics and deep-learning analyses of single-unit recordings we uncovered distinct coding patterns between anxiety-provoking and safe environments. Remarkably, systemic D1 activation, which heightens anxiety-related behaviors, strengthen this population coding dichotomy, by increasing the variability of the neural code for protected spaces, while increasing the reliability of the neural coding of anxiogenic spaces. Altogether, our findings provide a new model of neural population coding of anxiety and unravel D1-dependent coding mechanisms in the mouse anterior insula."

An influential theory proposes that the utility of behavior, i.e. the subjective valuation of the ratio between benefits and costs, jointly determines the speed of decisions and the vigor of movements (Shadmehr and Ahmed, 2020). For instance, if the prospect of obtaining rewards for moderate costs is high, then decisions will be rapid and movements vigorous (Thura, 2020). While investigating and describing some of the neural correlates of this mechanism in monkeys (Thura et al., 2022), we showed in the meantime that in humans, decision urgency and movement speed could also be unrelated and even controlled in opposite ways under specific circumstances (Reynaud et al., 2020; Saleri Lunazzi et al., 2021, 2023). This could potentially pose problems for inferring the neurophysiology of decision-making and action coordination in humans from monkey data, because there was no evidence that monkeys could also decouple their decisions and actions. By conducting another behavioral study in monkeys under conditions similar to those in which humans were tested, we recently showed that just like humans, monkeys are able to dissociate the control of their decisions and actions. Moreover, the data suggest that this decoupled control serves to optimize the utility of their behavior (Saleri and Thura, 2024). Together, our studies highlight a strong, flexible and adaptive coordination between decision-making and movement execution during interactive behavior of primates."

Yet both fields, I will argue, investigate the same core mechanisms: the fundamental computations of reinforcement learning. By explicitly linking these computations to emotions and moods, we not only gain new leverage to explain real-world behavior but also refine our models to better reflect how humans actually learn and plan. I will illustrate these advances through a large-scale, intensive longitudinal study using a bespoke mobile platform with wearable EEG. The results reveal mood as a vehicle of reinforcement learning and enable mood prediction up to five days in advance. This framework opens new paths for understanding how reinforcement learning functions adaptively, or goes awry."

Persecutory delusion (the belief that others are harmful) is a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia and is thought to stem from misinterpretations of social cues. However, contemporary neurocognitive models of delusions frequently neglect the social dimension. This project aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to the emergence of delusion, in particular persecutory delusion, by combining experimental psychology and computational modeling. Ketamine was used as a pharmacological model of psychosis, as it transiently and safely induces early schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individuals. However, the effects of ketamine on social inference remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a randomized, crossover study in which healthy volunteers received either ketamine or a placebo. A novel cognitive task was employed to investigate how subjects infer intentions to others from ambiguous social cues (i.e., faces displaying varying degrees of smiling or hostile expressions) to guide their decisions. Using a Bayesian computational approach, we demonstrated that ketamine alters the inference of intentions from facial expressions. Beyond refining the use of ketamine as a model of psychosis, these findings provide new insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying the emergence of persecutory delusion in schizophrenia."

Here, we examined the role of emotions in shaping people’s behaviour across two naturalistic task, one capturing foraging under threat and one capturing goal pursuit. We capture emotions through self-reports, as well as using a novel method of facial emotion recognition. Emotional traits were captured through standard questionnaires (apathy, anhedonia, anxiety etc.) in large online samples and linked to task behaviour and emotions. Finally, with 7T FMRI, we examined the neural subcortical underpinnings of task relevant computational quantities."

I will also show how direct electrical stimulation has helped uncover new functional subdivisions within these two brain regions.

Understanding the dynamics of peer influence during adolescence is therefore essential. This study compared the cognitive and neural processes of social learning in adolescents and adults, focusing on how uncertainty affects social information use. Participants completed a perceptual decision-making task where they could revise their initial estimate after viewing a peer’s estimate. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the amount of information provided before their decision and the peer’s reported confidence. Using model-free analyses and a Bayesian computational model, we found that both groups shared similar decision-making mechanisms, but adolescents were less sensitive to their own certainty and peer confidence, leading to reduced influence on social information use. fMRI revealed that adolescents showed a reduced neural response to peer confidence variations compared to adults, but exhibited a stronger initial response to variations in their own certainty. However, this heightened response diminished when personal and peer information were combined. These findings suggest ongoing neural development in adolescence may reduce metacognitive abilities and hinder the integration of precision signals, offering insights into how social information processing evolves with age."

It is established that the brain solves this challenge, in part, by representing social information in an “agent-centric” manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is “tagged” to individuals such as “oneself” or the “other” person with whom we are interacting. This intuitive approach has informed our understanding of dorsomedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC and ACC), key nodes of the social brain. However, the patterns or combinations in which the individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals themselves. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a social group-decision making task, I show dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions employed in spatial, visual, and motor domains. Critically, basis functions predict specific choice patterns such as counterintuitive effects where decision-irrelevant players systematically influence choice. These findings suggest that medial prefrontal cortex compresses complex social information along the basis functions to enable both computational efficiency and behavioural flexibility."

Classically, this aim has met several obstacles: The same cognitive process, such as decision making, is studied via vastly different behavioural paradigms across species, these paradigms rarely involve behaviours that naturally occur in the wild, and the resulting metrics are typically simplified, making it diffcult to track cognitive dynamics with precision. In this talk, we will show how our lab tackles these challenges by a) applying the exact same naturalistic and highly immersive VR foraging task in mice, monkeys and humans, and b) characterizing the resulting rich spontaneous decision processes in depth and trial by trial. With this approach, we show that facial expressions reflect highly similar cognitive state dynamics during perceptual decision making in mice and monkeys, that attentional states follow comparable patterns in mice, monkeys and humans, and that even altered states of consciousness may unfold in more similar ways across species than previously documented."

In small groups of genetically identical mice living together in home-cage, individuals spontaneously adopt different roles—some work to access food, others rely on them to feed, and some alternate. These behavioral profiles are not fixed: they depend on the social context. Male groups tend to form competitive hierarchies, female groups behave more uniformly, and introducing trained or dopamine-modulated individuals into naïve groups reshapes group organization. These roles are linked to activity in a key brain area for motivation—the ventral tegmental area—and modeled using reinforcement learning principles. Altogether, the results suggest a feedback loop where social interactions influence brain activity, which in turn stabilizes individual behaviors and group structure."

While previous studies have focused on unidimensional rewards (e.g., money), real-world rewards are typically multidimensional and require trade-offs across competing needs. To better capture this complexity, we developed a novel fruit-picking task where participants chose among fruits that fulfilled two needs, hydration and energy. Two fruits satisfied only one need, while a third provided moderate amounts of both. Participants had to integrate their current hydration and energy levels to identify the optimal choice. We hypothesized that anhedonia would impair this ability to integrate different reward dimensions. Against prediction, across five studies (Ns = 140, 169, 375, 180, and 192), higher self-reported anticipatory anhedonia was consistently associated with more accurate selection of the mixed-reward option, particularly when the discrepancy between two reward dimensions was small. This effect persisted even in task variants that removed sequential planning demands and when controlling for performance on a separate unidimensional bandit task. These findings suggest that anhedonia, though typically viewed as maladaptive, may in some contexts reflect enhanced sensitivity to unsatisfied needs and enhanced integration of competing reward dimensions."

These sequences are multifaceted such that they can contain a set of abstract tasks (e.g., when making a meal: cut vegetables, heat the pan) that are independent from the precise motor actions needed to carry them out, and can also include a series of the precise muscle contractions needed to produce a motor sequence (e.g., picking a fruit off a tree). Presumably, processes control at the abstract level and keep track or monitor progress throughout sequences. Despite this presumption, the vast majority of studies that have studied sequences have focused on motor actions (e.g., a series of joystick movements, eye movements, or finger taps) while neglecting the control and sequential monitoring processes that occur simultaneously. We have made progress in understanding the neural bases of nonmotor sequential tasks across human and nonhuman primates. Using fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in humans and awake fMRI and electrophysiology in nonhuman primates, we show that the lateral prefrontal cortex represents sequential information across sequence types and species. Further, these representations share a common dynamic, increasing activity across individual sequences (“ramping”). Current studies are focusing on investigating these dynamics during using fMRI- guided electrophysiological recordings. Together these studies provide a unique view of complex cognitive processes across species, step towards understanding functional homology, and provide insight into sequential processes during health and disorder."
