    "text": "This year, SBDM hosts a satellite event dedicated to social networks just after the main conference, on June 19th.\nThe event is free but registration is mandatory. If you are interested please send an email with subject “network workshop” to eliasdrewalter@gmail.com.\n\n\nWhen\nJune 19th, Lyon, France\n\n\nWhere\nLocation : Institut des Sciences Cognitives, 67 bd Pinel, 69675 Bron, France\nGoogle map link\n\n\nOrganizers\nJean-Claude Dreher, Marie-Claire Villeval, Frédéric Moisan and Astrid Hopfensitz\n\n\nSynopsis\nSocial and economic networks play a crucial role in shaping individual and collective decision-making by influencing how individuals process information, form beliefs, and interact strategically. The structure of these networks affects economic behavior, market dynamics, and collaboration and coordination within organizations, with implications for financial stability, cooperation, competition, and policy adoption. Understanding how individuals make decisions within these interconnected systems is essential for addressing challenges such as the spread of misinformation, political polarization, and social conformity. While behavioral economics and computational social science have made progress in modeling decision-making in structured environments, many questions remain about the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms driving these processes. Advances in these fields provide valuable insights into how individuals process social and economic incentives, update beliefs based on network interactions, and navigate complex strategic environments. This workshop will bring together perspectives from economics, psychology, and computational social neuroscience to explore how individuals make decisions in social and economic contexts. Through recent empirical and theoretical approaches, we aim to deepen our understanding of decision-making in networked environments.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nOriel Feldman Hall (neuroscience - Brown Univ) - https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/\nDamon Centolla (sociology - University of Pennsylvania) - https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/damon-centola-phd\nEdo Gallo (economics - Cambridge) - https://www.edoardogallo.com\nFriederike Mengel (economics - Essex) - https://sites.google.com/site/friederikemengel/\nArno Riedl (behavioral economics – Maastricht) - https://www.arnoriedl.com/\nJean-Claude Dreher (neuroeconomics – Lyon) - https://dreherteam.wixsite.com/neuroeconomics\nFrédéric Moisan (behavioral economics, Lyon) - https://em-lyon.com/en/frederic-moisan/research"
