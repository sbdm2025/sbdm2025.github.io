#### Decisions and bodily signals

In this talk, I will show how both perceptual and preference-based decision making depend on cardiac and gastric signals, in experimental situations that emotionally neutral and in the absence of physiological challenge. I propose, and test, the hypothesis that the interplay between decisions and bodily signals is related to the self - the subject of experience, the subject for whom outcomes matter.
