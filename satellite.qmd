### Synopsis

Social and economic networks play a crucial role in shaping individual
and collective decision-making by influencing how individuals process
information, form beliefs, and interact strategically. The structure of
these networks affects economic behavior, market dynamics, and
collaboration and coordination within organizations, with implications
for financial stability, cooperation, competition, and policy adoption.
Understanding how individuals make decisions within these interconnected
systems is essential for addressing challenges such as the spread of
misinformation, political polarization, and social conformity. While
behavioral economics and computational social science have made progress
in modeling decision-making in structured environments, many questions
remain about the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms driving these
processes. Advances in these fields provide valuable insights into how
individuals process social and economic incentives, update beliefs based
on network interactions, and navigate complex strategic environments.
This workshop will bring together perspectives from economics,
psychology, and computational social neuroscience to explore how
individuals make decisions in social and economic contexts. Through
recent empirical and theoretical approaches, we aim to deepen our
understanding of decision-making in networked environments.

    **Title**: Cognitive maps of social networks

    The success of the human species depends on our ability to
    successfully navigate through our complex social communities, where
    our friends are connected to many others, who are in turn connected
    to others, and so on. Our social networks are extraordinarily dense,
    complex, and continually evolving as friendships are made and
    broken. It is an enormous challenge to figure out how people are
    connected within a network, and continually update one’s
    representation as the network inevitably shifts over time. Yet,
    knowing your social network’s structure affords many advantages,
    such as being able to disseminate information, manage one’s own (and
    others) reputations, or even strategically figure out how to occupy
    a central position. I will discuss our recent research probing the
    mechanisms that underpin how humans learn about the relationships in
    social networks, and the format of representation they use to encode
    these social networks: abstract cognitive maps. We find that
    abstract maps are used to solve multiple different social navigation
    problems, from climbing the social ladder into positions of
    influence to learning to gossip with the right people.

    **Title**: Brain computations engaged in social network interactions

    Social networks play a crucial role in creating links between
    individuals and in informal transmission of information across
    society. Although the computations engaged in social learning have
    started to be investigated in dyadic interactions and in very small
    groups, little is known about the mechanisms used by the brain when
    individuals interact in social networks. I will present recent
    theoretical and experimental work shedding light on the computations
    people use to integrate and transmit information in social networks.
    I will show that a variant of the classical DeGroot learning rule
    captures transmission of information in social networks better than
    a sequential error-driven process using successive weighted update
    of one’s neighbors’ opinions. I will also present recent fMRI
    results showing how the brain decides whether to share extra
    information with others, depending upon one’s own confidence about
    the reliability of information and upon our beliefs concerning the
    preferences of receivers. Finally, I will present an Agent-Based
    model of dynamic network formation where individuals act
    asynchronously based on a partial view of the network. This model
    converges towards the most efficient network structure, showing that
    seemingly complex behaviors in such game emerges from decentralized,
    homogenous, payoff-driven agents. Together, these results pave the
    way to develop a mechanistic understanding of social learning
    mechanisms used by networked individuals interacting dynamically in
    real time.

    **Title**: Money vs social exclusion in networks

    Globalization offers unparalleled opportunities to expand economic
    welfare across large networks of unrelated individuals. Social
    exclusion – permanent or temporary – and monetary exchange are
    institutions that in theory can incentivize cooperation. In an
    experiment, we evaluate their relative performance and interaction
    in anonymous networks of different sizes. Permanent social exclusion
    (ostracism) leads to sparse networks, which reduces long-run
    economic potential. Monetary exchange and temporary social exclusion
    perform similarly well in small networks. Yet, in large networks
    monetary exchange is the only institution that promotes full
    cooperation as it completely crowds out ostracism and maintains the
    network intact. An insight is that monetary systems outperform
    social exclusion mechanisms in promoting cooperation in globalized
    social and economic networks.

    **Title**: Influence in Social Networks

    In a series of laboratory and online experiments, we investigate the
    perceived and actual influence, direct and indirect, that early
    movers have over later movers in a sequential-move binary-action
    coordination game played on a network. Each human subject is
    assigned to a particular node in a specified 5 or 10 node network,
    and chooses In or Out knowing how many neighbors have previously
    chosen In. We measure influence in terms of the number of In choices
    that follow an initial exogenous In versus Out choice. Influence is
    quite heterogeneous across different network positions. Human
    subjects are aware of their influence and act on it, but
    overestimate their influence on average. A simple adaptive learning
    model explains entry and perceptions of influence reasonably well,
    especially for well connected nodes.

    **Title**: The "New" Science of Collective Intelligence

    Can networks protect us from disinformation?  Can the science of collective intelligence restore our capacity for productive online discourse? I offer new findings on the intelligence of collectives, which show that the greatest source of group wisdom is people’s ability to influence one another. However, the key to our collective intelligence lies in the structure of that influence. I present results from a series of independently replicated and experimentally controlled online disinformation campaigns regarding vaccine safety. I show how changes to the topological connectivity of online networks enable “wisdom of the crowd” learning dynamics that effectively counteract disinformation campaigns, even among homogeneous populations (i.e., “echo chambers”) subjected to targeted attacks. These results reveal an unexpected relationship between network structure and the emotional quality of online discussions, which correspond to significant changes in communities’ endogenous capacity for distributed collective learning.

    **Title**: Experimental Evidence on Group Size Effects in Network
    Formation Games

    This paper presents experimental evidence on games where individuals
    can unilaterally decide on their links with each other. Linking
    decisions give rise to directed graphs. We consider two classes of
    situations: one, benefits flow along the direction of the network
    paths (one-way flow), and two, when the benefits flow on network
    paths without regard to the direction of links (two-way flow). Our
    experiments reveal that in the one-way flow model subjects create
    sparse networks whose distance grows and efficiency falls as group
    size grows; by contrast, in the two-way flow model subjects create
    sparse and small world networks whose efficiency remains high in
    both small and large groups. We show that a bounded rational model
    that combines myopic best response with targeting a most connected
    individual provides a coherent account of our experimental data.

    **Title**: Coordination and Network Proximity: Experimental Evidence
    from the Field (with Ben D'Exelle and Christine Gutekunst)

    We conduct a field experiment in real-world social networks to
    analyse the influence of network proximity on the ability of two
    persons to coordinate costly effort. Using data on the friendship
    networks of 22 villages in Uganda, we identify the effect of
    proximity between two participants by experimentally varying the
    effort costs and the disclosure of their identities. We find that
    effort in the coordination task is higher if the paired participants
    are friends and have common friends, i.e., they are part of the same
    triad. We do not find support for alternative measures of network
    proximity that involve a different combination of direct and common
    friends.
