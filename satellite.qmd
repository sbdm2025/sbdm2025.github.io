### Synopsis

Social and economic networks play a crucial role in shaping individual
and collective decision-making by influencing how individuals process
information, form beliefs, and interact strategically. The structure of
these networks affects economic behavior, market dynamics, and
collaboration and coordination within organizations, with implications
for financial stability, cooperation, competition, and policy adoption.
Understanding how individuals make decisions within these interconnected
systems is essential for addressing challenges such as the spread of
misinformation, political polarization, and social conformity. While
behavioral economics and computational social science have made progress
in modeling decision-making in structured environments, many questions
remain about the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms driving these
processes. Advances in these fields provide valuable insights into how
individuals process social and economic incentives, update beliefs based
on network interactions, and navigate complex strategic environments.
This workshop will bring together perspectives from economics,
psychology, and computational social neuroscience to explore how
individuals make decisions in social and economic contexts. Through
recent empirical and theoretical approaches, we aim to deepen our
understanding of decision-making in networked environments.
